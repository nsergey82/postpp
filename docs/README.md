- **Mapping Database**: SQLite-based persistence layer storing local-to-global ID mappings for data synchronization
- **EVault Client**: GraphQL client interface providing operations for storing, updating, and referencing MetaEnvelopes
- **eVault Provisioner**: Handles creation and configuration of new eVaults through registry and provisioner services
- **Schema Manager**: Manages JSON schema mappings and validation rules for different platform data structures
- **Logger System**: Structured logging infrastructure with configurable transports for audit and debugging

### 6. Class Diagram
**File:** [diagrams/04-class-diagram.md](diagrams/04-class-diagram.md)

Shows the key classes and their relationships in both W3ID and eVault Core systems:

#### W3ID Core Classes:
- **W3ID**: Main identity class with JWT signing capabilities
- **W3IDBuilder**: Builder pattern for creating W3ID instances
- **IDLogManager**: Manages immutable event logging
- **StorageSpec\<T, R\>**: Generic storage interface
- **LogService**: Neo4j implementation of StorageSpec
- **SecretsStore**: Encrypted secret management

#### eVault Core Classes:
- **MetaEnvelope\<T\>**: Data structure with ontology and ACL
- **Envelope\<T\>**: Individual data container with type information
- **DbService**: Neo4j database operations
- **GraphQLServer**: GraphQL server with webhook support
- **VaultAccessGuard**: Authentication and authorization middleware
- **EVaultClient**: Client for eVault operations with health monitoring

#### Supporting Types and Interfaces:
- **Signer**: Cryptographic signing interface
- **LogEvent**: W3ID event log structure
- **VaultContext**: GraphQL context with authentication info

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. **W3ID Integration Pattern**
All components authenticate through the W3ID system:
1. Obtain W3ID token through authentication
2. Include token in Authorization header
3. Access resources based on W3ID permissions and ACL

### 2. **MetaEnvelope Data Model**
The eVault uses a hierarchical data structure:
- **MetaEnvelope**: Top-level container with ontology classification
- **Envelope**: Individual data items with type information
- **ACL**: Fine-grained access control per MetaEnvelope

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- W3ID maintains immutable event logs for identity operations
- eVault sends webhook notifications to platforms on data changes
- Control Panel streams real-time events via Server-Sent Events

### 4. **Microservices Architecture**
- Each container is independently deployable
- Services communicate via HTTP/GraphQL APIs
- Registry service enables dynamic service discovery

### 5. **Storage Strategy**
- Neo4j graph database for complex data relationships
- File-based encrypted storage for secrets
- In-memory caching for performance optimization

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies:
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Node.js
- **Frameworks**: Fastify, GraphQL Yoga, SvelteKit, Tauri
- **Database**: Neo4j (graph database)
- **Build System**: TurboRepo with pnpm
- **Code Quality**: Biome (linting/formatting), Vitest (testing)

### Key Libraries:
- **Identity**: W3ID with UUID v4/v5, JWT signing with `jose`
- **Cryptography**: TweetNaCl for signing and encryption
- **Testing**: Vitest with TestContainers for integration tests
- **UI Components**: Svelte with Storybook for component development

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: `pnpm install` from root installs all dependencies
2. **Development**: Use `pnpm dev` for parallel development
3. **Testing**: `pnpm test` runs tests across all packages
4. **Quality**: `pnpm check` ensures formatting, linting, and types
5. **Building**: `pnpm build` creates production builds

## Environment Requirements

- Node.js â‰¥18
- pnpm package manager
- Neo4j database for eVault Core
- Docker for containerized development (`pnpm dev:evault`)
